            <p class="secsubtag textsmall">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education
                system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India <br>
                Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality,
                reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning
                outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
                technology.

            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall"> The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to
                be a major “silent hindrance” for Indias track to greater development. While all the attention is on
                social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power
                to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must
                for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a
                lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren't actually visible….

                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…</p>

            <p class="secsubtag textsmall"> The increasing interest in creative education is due to the need for more
                critical thinkers in business science, politics and every subject to be able to solve complex
                problems.[1] As the world becomes more interconnected, it is no longer possible to make linear decisions
                in business and in politics. Current leaders are looking for people who can bring about new ideas to
                solve pressing issues. For instance, in a 2010 IBM study, Chief Executive Officers from more than 60
                countries and 33 different industries worldwide were surveyed on creativity. Those 1,500 CEOs believe
                that in order for the industries to keep growing in this increasingly complex world, creative strategies
                must be implemented in education.</p>
